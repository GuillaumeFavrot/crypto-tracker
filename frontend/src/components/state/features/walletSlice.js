// This file houses all reducers and action creators functions.
// All action creators and reducers can now be written in the same file known as a slice. 
// Its is possible to write all redux logic in one single slice file however splitting this logic in multiple slices is also possible.
// There is multiple ways to write this file.
// In this template this file has been setup to use :
//  => createAsyncThunk : this function is the new recommended way to handle asynchronous call within redux 
//  => Axios : this packages handles http request. It has been chosen in this template because it has better error handling than regular fetch requests
//  => Async/await : to handle asynchronous db calls. 
// This template features the four main types of DB requests.

let url = ''
  // If no base URL (or an empty string) is given the main app address will be used. In production this is fine because the main Heroku app address serves the Django app.
  // Since React is also served by Django the correct URL is used.
  // However in development React runs on its own server so we have to specify the address (the Django server address) where requests have to be sent.
  // This section is generic and does not have to be modified.

// All action creators are rigged to handle basic CRUD operations and throw query errors.
// Just modify the function and variable names to suit your needs.

// All reducers are standard and do not need many modifications except the name of the action creators.
